# WSL1 and Docker for Windows

## Preparation

Install [Docker for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

In Docker -> general settings, youâ€™ll want to expose the daemon without TLS. However, do not allow it in the Windows Firewall. We only stay on localhost.
Docker Kubenetes is not needed in this workshop.

## Install WSL

If not already done:

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
Restart your computer when prompted.

The Linux distribution is installed via the Windows Store.
Microsoft Store: [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6)
The first time you start Ubutu, a user name and password will be created. The password is required for sudo.

## WSL (Ubuntu)

This guide describes how to configure WSL1 to use Docker for Windows:

```BASH
# Switch to root
sudo su

# Install Azure CLI (AZ):
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

# Update the apt package list. Install pip anf git client.
apt-get update -y

# Install Docker's package dependencies.
apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common

# Download and add Docker's official public PGP key.
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Verify the fingerprint.
apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

# Add the `stable` channel's Docker upstream repository.
add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

# Update the apt package list (for the new apt repo). Install the latest version of Docker CE, git and PIP.
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y \
   docker-ce \
   git \
   python python-pip

# Allow your user to access the Docker CLI without needing root access.
usermod -aG docker $USER

# Docker for Windows expects you to supply your volume paths in a format that matches this: /c/Users/nick/dev/myapp
ln -s /mnt/c /c

# exit sudo
exit

# Install Docker Compose into your user's home directory.
pip install --user docker-compose

# Configure WSL to Connect to Docker for Windows
echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# You should get a bunch of output about your Docker daemon.
# If you get a permission denied error, close + open your terminal and try again.
docker info

# You should get back your Docker Compose version.
docker-compose --version
```
